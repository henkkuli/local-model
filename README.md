# Formalizing Foundations of the LOCAL Model

This is my attempt at formalizing the foundations of the LOCAL model using Lean.
The definitions and theorems are based on the book of [Distributed Algorithms course](https://jukkasuomela.fi/da2020/) here at Aalto University.

## Current Progress
- [x] Port-numbered network (`PNNetwork`)
- [x] Covering maps (`CoveringMap`)
- [x] PN algorithms (`PNAlgorithm`)
- [x] PN algorithms cannot distinguish covering maps (`PNAlgorithm.covering_map_indistinguishable`)
- [ ] Define LOCAL model
